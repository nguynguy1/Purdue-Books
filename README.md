# Purdue-Books
Purdue Books will serve as a one-stop platform for students to figure out which books they will need for their classes. A lot of Purdue students have to constantly check the syllabus for the corresponding books, so our platform will solve that issue by being an accessible site to find all the books corresponding to the classes. Students will be able to see important information relating to the specific course, like the required books for the course, the professor's rating, the ratings of the assigned books, etc.
